[Ajax push, Reverse Ajax, Two-way-web, HTTP_Streaming & HTTP Server Push]


web application model for server push
umbrella term for many techniques

-- Techniques
 Hidden iframe (forever frame)
 	iframe links to url that never ends
 	page is sent as chunked blocks of script-tags containg js to be executed
 	since browsers render HTML pages incrementally, each script-tag is executed as it is recieved
 	+ works in every common browser
 	- lack of reliable error handling
 	- impossible tracking of the state of the request calling process

 Ajax polling
 	1. setInterval-technique
 	- what if it takes server longer than X seconds to 	respond?
 	2. setTimeout-technique
 	- alot of wasted connections
